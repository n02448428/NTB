# Neon Trailblazer

A modern, customizable light cycle game inspired by classic arcade games with evolving AI opponents and extensive visual effect options.

## Description

Neon Trailblazer is a browser-based 3D game where players navigate a light cycle through a neon grid, leaving trails behind that become obstacles. The game features advanced AI opponents that learn and evolve as they play, getting more intelligent with each generation.

What sets Neon Trailblazer apart is its extensive visual customization system, allowing players to adjust everything from pixelation to glitch effects, bloom lighting, scanlines, and color shifts to create their perfect retro-futuristic aesthetic.
